## 🚀 Setup & Run Instructions

### 1) Clone the repository
```bash

cd UMBRELLA
````

### 2) Install dependencies

flutter run
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

### What our tests cover

We implemented at least **2 meaningful tests** (1 unit test + 1 widget test) and ensured `flutter test` passes successfully.

1. **Unit Test — `test/settings_state_unit_test.dart`**
   Verifies that `SettingsState` loads preferences from `SharedPreferences`, updates them through setter methods, and persists values across new `SettingsState` instances.

2. **Widget Test — `test/settings_state_widget_umbrella_toggle_test.dart`**
   Pumps a minimal UI using `Provider`, waits for `SettingsState` to finish loading, taps the toggle button, and confirms the displayed text updates when `showUmbrellaIndex` changes.

3. **Smoke Test — `test/widget_test.dart`**
   Simple sanity check to ensure the test pipeline runs correctly.

## Known Limitations / Notes

* Some background features (e.g., notifications / background tasks) may behave differently on emulators due to OS restrictions.
* If location permissions are denied, weather-based features may be limited.
